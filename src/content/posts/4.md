## Friction Factor $f$
- Definition
- Why define it?
- Solving real-world problems 
    1. Determine interphase transport through **experimental data**.
    2. Find correlation between **dimensionless** groups.

## Case 1: Flow in a Pipe
- Find relation between **$\Delta P$ & $Q$**
- $F_k$ & $f$

### Macroscopic Perspective
- Purpose: Calculate $f$ from experimental data (pressure difference)
- Prove

### Microscopic Perspective
- Purpose: $f = f(Re)$ -> Plot **f vs Re** curves -> 查Re就可得到f
- Prove

### Examples

## Case 2: Flow around a sphere
- Find relation between **$V_{\infty}$ & $F_D$**
- $F_k$ & $f$
