## Friction Factor $f$
- Definition
- Why define it?

## Any Flow in Tubes
### Macroscopic Perspective
- Purpose: Calculate $f$ from experimental data (pressure difference)
- Balancing the forces to get f

### Microscopic Perspective
- Purpose: $f = f(Re)$ -> Plot f vs Re (a curve) -> 查Re就可得到f
- Prove
